Computer Vision HW6

Use the Laws texture energy measures and the K-mean clustering algorithm to perform segmentation on the zebra image. Set the K to 4, 5, and 6 in the clustering algorithm and compare the results. Show the segmentation output by assigning different grey tones to the pixels in different clusters.
